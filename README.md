## Description
The city of Chicago, Illinois has a significantly higher crime rate than the rest of the United States. Researchers have investigated crime in Chicago for decades but the majority of studies exclusively focus on violent crime. The purpose of this project is to find interesting relationships between the various types of crime that occur in Chicago, the date they occur, and their location. By data mining the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR database of reported instances of crime we could potentially find unintuitive information that can aid in the process of crime prevention and reduction. This project intends to provide a more holistic view of the geo-temporal relationships of crime in Chicago. We will be using Python, Jupyter Notebooks and R for this project, relying heavily on Python as our main tool. We will utilize Python's libraries, including numpy, pandas, scipy.stats, etcetera.

## Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers
#### How do types and amount of crime change throughout the city?
We found a general pattern of decreasing crime over the year with seasonal peaks and lows in the summer and winter respectively. Using our visualizations alone we can see a general trend of more crime in the southern side of Chicago when taking the eastward bias into account.
#### Which neighborhoods can we classify as generally unsafe?
We see a pattern of more violence in the south side of the city. This coincides with the higher number of arrests there as well.
#### Can we predict future specific crime trends in certain neighborhoods?
In general we can predict a focus of crime in the southside
