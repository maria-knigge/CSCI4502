## Description
The city of Chicago, Illinois has a significantly higher crime rate than the rest of the United States. Researchers have investigated crime in Chicago for decades but the majority of studies exclusively focus on violent crime. The purpose of this project is to find interesting relationships between the various types of crime that occur in Chicago, the date they occur, and their location. By data mining the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR database of reported instances of crime we could potentially find unintuitive information that can aid in the process of crime prevention and reduction. This project intends to provide a more holistic view of the geo-temporal relationships of crime in Chicago. We will be using Python, Jupyter Notebooks and R for this project, relying heavily on Python as our main tool. We will utilize Python's libraries, including numpy, pandas, scipy.stats, etcetera.
